This game has dynamically-generated music.  Please use speakers or headphones.




== Controls ==

Press ESC to pause the game and view a menu screen.

The mouse is used for almost all actions in the game, except for:

Moving your character:   Arrow keys, W A S D keys, or I J K L keys.


If the movement keys are not comfortable on your keyboard, edit 
"settings/upDownLeftRightKeys.ini" with a text editor to 
specify your own set of four keys (change "wasd" to "tfgh", for example).




== Screen Size ==

If the game doesn't look good at the default 640x480 full-screen on your 
monitor, you can edit the screen dimensions in the "settings" folder.  You
can also toggle full-screen mode.  Once the game has been started in 
full-screen mode, you can switch to windowed mode by pressing Alt-Enter.

If the game seems sluggish at the default 60 frames-per-second, 
particularly when entering things (which is the most CPU-intensive part of 
the game), try switching to 30 FPS by putting a 1 in 
"settings/halfFrameRate.ini".

If it still seems sluggish at 30 FPS, switch to 15 FPS by putting a 2 in 
that settings file.  If it still seems sluggish, try 7.5 FPS by putting a 3 
in that settings file, and so on.
