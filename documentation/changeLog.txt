Version 3  ???

--Fixed bug in game playback that could not handle extra recording argument 
  (change highlights on/off flag).

--Fixed a server-side bug that was causing house pings to fail when a user was
  editing their house after robbing a house, and the robbed house was
  simultaneously being edited by that house's owner (thanks Jeremiah Reid, who 
  was spuriously timed out of his house 20 times). 

--Fixed SQL query bug when searching house tables in web admin UI.

--Dealt with houses-to-rob scarcity issue by keeping houses robbable after they
  are successfully robbed the first time, as their money dwindles.  Before, a
  house could only be robbed once before going back on the must-edit-again
  queue. 

--Fixed server bug that caused paintings to disappear from circulation when 
  family members killed but vault not reached.

--Server prevents a dual-client setup from keeping robber's own house checked 
  out for edit during robbery and other non-edit actions.

--Fixed bug that allowed walking over electrified floors post-robbery.



Version 2    2013-February-27    (private pre-alpha)

--Added recording and playback of time() values in game recording system.  This
  fixes playback timing bugs when the playback machine runs the game slower
  or faster than the original recording machine (or when playback is manually
  slowed or sped up).

--Removed an error-prone initial mouse-warp-to-center call that was potentially
  causing future mouse motion events to be ignored.
  
--Fixed server typo that resulted in stolen paintings not being added to the
  robber's house (thanks Allen Trivette).

--Fixed TextField glitchy behavior when user types forbidden characters.

--Fixed major bug in path finding for family-blocked-in detection 
  (thanks Eric McQuiggan). 

--Fixed tool tip bug that triggered music toggle button tip spuriously 
  (thanks Garrett).

--Fixed so that empty self-test recordings (when user edits backpack but 
  not house map) do not replace last valid self-test recording in database.

--Fixed 'Family blocked in' message overlaying Done button on house load.

--Fixed dead wife sprites overhanging walls (and also moved all dead objects 
  under wall shadows, which looks much better).

--Added better logging of flush operations on server.

--Fixed lingering pitbull attack stance post-robbery.

--Fixed so that erase highlights (darkening) in editor match state of object 
  being erased.

--Changed so that picking up a family member who is standing with a mobile does
  not erase that mobile.

--Fixed so that dead wife not shown carrying money during self tests.

--Security tapes are now saved whenever a robber dies (so owners can see their 
  traps working).

--Added push-doors (thanks Nicholas Rodine).

--Tweaked window position to line up with push-doors.

--Fixed typing @ on Spanish keyboards (thanks Manuel Magalhaes).

--Fixed window title.

--Greatly improved seek/avoid mobile behavior so that they don't get stuck on 
  corners (thanks Nicholas Rodine).

--Added key repeat after holding movement key for 0.5+ seconds (to move across 
  house with less tedium than pressing [->] 32 times).

--Added 'Pick one:' to picker grids to make them less confusing (thanks 
  Madeleine Burleson).

--Leaving house edit due to inactivity now returns you to the menu instead of 
  right back to checking out your own house (less confusing if your house is 
  being robbed in the meantime).

--Changed so that house never times out during first edit (when house isn't 
  vulnerable to being robbed anyway, because you must edit it first) (thanks 
  Madeleine Burleson).

--Added suicide button to edit page when balance is 0.

--Revamped house edit billing to only charge for differences from old map,
  allowing you to place, erase, and replace walls many times during the same
  editing session without incuring cost of each replacement.  Makes editing
  much more fluid and less Undo-button dependent.  Also allows mobiles
  to be moved around without cost (because you are only charged for those 
  placed in excess of the ones already in your house).

--Added (optional) highlight features that shows the changes made to the
  current house map as you edit it.
