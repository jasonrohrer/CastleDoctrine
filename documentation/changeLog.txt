  concurrency issues (my web server had InnoDB disabled before).

  clauses for high-volume queries (this also prevents entire table from being
  locked).

--Paging display for log entries, and stack traces in log for fatal errors.

--Fixed MiB and GiB formatting in database size report.

--Fixed server bug that caused start of self-test to fail after house checkin

  client is retrying the request (thanks Jeremy Oertel).

  quits after dying but before editing house).




Version 5   2013-March-11

--Ridiculous.  Forgot to update client version number from 3 to 4 in last

--Fixed bug in game playback that could not handle extra recording argument 
  (change highlights on/off flag).

--Fixed a server-side bug that was causing house pings to fail when a user was
  editing their house after robbing a house, and the robbed house was

  was spuriously timed out of his house 20 times). 

--Fixed SQL query bug when searching house tables in web admin UI.

--Dealt with houses-to-rob scarcity issue by keeping houses robbable after they
  are successfully robbed the first time, as their money dwindles.  Before, a
  house could only be robbed once before going back on the must-edit-again
  queue.

  family members killed but vault not reached.

--Server prevents a dual-client setup from keeping robber's own house checked 
  out for edit during robbery and other non-edit actions.

  main menu (thanks Jeremiah Reid).

  pick a house from the to-rob list and try to click that tape button).

  McCrimmon).

  owners 5 days.

  from house.

--Server now has a shutdown mode to block player requests during maintenance.

--Fixed so that remapping WASD keys doesn't interfer with typing for searches.

--Game client times out requests to server after 16 seconds and retries them
  instead of giving up.

--Fixed house pick lists so that tool tips don't linger when mouse leaves.

--Removed down arrow when house pick list has a full page of results but no
  additional pages ((thanks Jeremiah Reid).

--Water wakes sleeping animals.  Sleeping animals can be killed.  Bricks wake
  sleeping pit bulls.  Bricks kill chihuahuas and cats.

--Ladder tool to cross trapdoors and pits.

--Fixed stickiness of voltage detectors applied to wires and fixed a stickiness
  bug with pit bulls fallen inside a closed trapdoor.





Version 2    2013-February-27    (private pre-alpha)

  fixes playback timing bugs when the playback machine runs the game slower

  causing future mouse motion events to be ignored.

  (thanks Garrett).

--Fixed so that empty self-test recordings (when user edits backpack but 
  not house map) do not replace last valid self-test recording in database.

--Fixed 'Family blocked in' message overlaying Done button on house load.

--Fixed dead wife sprites overhanging walls (and also moved all dead objects 
  under wall shadows, which looks much better).

--Added better logging of flush operations on server.

--Fixed lingering pitbull attack stance post-robbery.

  being erased.

--Fixed window title.

--Greatly improved seek/avoid mobile behavior so that they don't get stuck on 
  corners (thanks Nicholas Rodine).

  house with less tedium than pressing [->] 32 times).

--Added 'Pick one:' to picker grids to make them less confusing (thanks 
  Madeleine Burleson).

--Leaving house edit due to inactivity now returns you to the menu instead of 
  right back to checking out your own house (less confusing if your house is 
  being robbed in the meantime).

  vulnerable to being robbed anyway, because you must edit it first) (thanks 
  Madeleine Burleson).

--Added suicide button to edit page when balance is 0.

--Revamped house edit billing to only charge for differences from old map,
  allowing you to place, erase, and replace walls many times during the same
  editing session without incuring cost of each replacement.  Makes editing
  much more fluid and less Undo-button dependent.  Also allows mobiles
  to be moved around without cost (because you are only charged for those 
  placed in excess of the ones already in your house).

--Added (optional) highlight features that shows the changes made to the
  current house map as you edit it.
