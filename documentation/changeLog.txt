Version 2    ???

--Added recording and playback of time() values in game recording system.  This
  fixes playback timing bugs when the playback machine runs the game slower
  or faster than the original recording machine (or when playback is manually
  slowed or sped up).

--Removed an error-prone initial mouse-warp-to-center call that was potentially
  causing future mouse motion events to be ignored.
  
--Fixed server typo that resulted in stolen paintings not being added to the
  robber's house (thanks Allen Trivette).
