Version 21

--Fixed inconsistency in family movement trigger when house view shifts as
  robber nears edge of screen (thanks Zed).




Version 20   Live Server Fixes

--Added a get_price_list server public API call (thanks Ukuko).




Version 20   2013-October-18

--Fixed bug that allowed wife to shoot robber while robber is on welcome mat,
  allowing robber to strangely recover from death by leaving the house (thanks 
  Colorfusion).

--Fixed tape playback page title text when tape value represents a bounty
  earned.

--Sleeping animals no longer jump back (mysteriously, while sleeping) to their
  original location after a successful robbery.

--Improved visibility of sleeping animals by bringing them up above wall
  shadows and giving them dark outlines just like other living mobiles.

--Returned to v15-style animal movement (animals start following/fleeing when
  they see you, but continue moving toward/away from you even after you move
  out of view).

--Added a panic button that can be pressed by family as they run out.

--Moved shotgun up slightly to make it more visible when surrounded by walls.

--Changed so that murder bounty is based on total number of people killed
  instead of just counting each murderous outing.





Version 19   Live Server Fixes

--Wired wooden walls brought back to the game.

--Added a price tweak factors on server so that overall tile/tool price ratios
  can be adjusted more easily.  Started off with tile prices tweaked down to
  2/5 what they used to be (to allow more house building with the starting
  budget).




Version 19   2013-October-15

--Fixed an obscure bug where the tool/tile grid-picker pages could get stuck in
  a state where they would repeatedly kick you out of your house (thanks Josh
  Collins).

--Added a bounty that builds up on a robber over time to be earned by whatever
  house finally kills the robber (starting bounty 500, +500 for each theft,
  +1000 for each instance of murder).  Trying bounties in conjuction with no
  salaries (thanks Joshua Collins).

--Added a shotgun object that can be placed in the house and picked up by the
  wife as she walks across it.  Kills robber short range (when adjacent).  Wife
  collects and holds bounty for robbers that she kills.

--Fixed corner gap visibility inconsistency by applying simpler algorithm 
  (thanks Joshua Collins).

--Added a 256-step power propagation limit to prevent complex circuits that
  take many propagations to either loop or settle from potentially freezing
  the game (thanks Joshua Collins).

--Blocked quitting from house check-in/out pages when quitting could kill the
  player.




Version 18   Live Server Fixes

--Gun price up to 1200 to strengthen Pit Bulls somewhat, and Powered Door price
  down to 600 to compensate for door drawbacks.

--Chills are now put on all houses player entered in the last hour when player
  dies, regardless of where player dies.  Player is haunted by what they did
  during the last hour of their past life.  This closes the "go home and kill
  yourself to get more money and try that house again" exploit.

--All tools dumped at the end of a robbery (including when reaching vault or
  running out the door) are now added to the vault.  This is safe now, because
  the suicide-at-home exploit has been closed.

--Changed from a linear bypass-cost curve to a sqrt-based curve, creating
  diminishing returns as you build with more expensive tiles, and increasing
  the viability of low-end house designs.

--Lowered cost of bypassing an ON electric floor from 400 to 100 to compensate
  for the fact that it passes power, so it's more powerful than other
  bottlenecks.

--Fixed possible negative balance when selling tools to buy paintings but
  quitting the game before house check-in (thanks Colorfusion).

--Added parameter for how many times a vault can be reached before vault
  salary stops, and upped that parameter from 2 to 4 to increase size of
  house list.

--Reduced minimum salary from 0.50 of max down to 0.10 of max to help
  well-designed starting houses survive the night better.

--Chills now only apply if you die in a house OR use tools in a house
  (thanks Jere).

--Fixed bug in way that MySQL UPDATE success was being detected, which
  occasionally would cause retried start_self_test, end_self_test, and
  ping_house calls to fail, leading to unfair player death (thanks Joshua
  Collins).

--Added better reporting of server Notices and Warnings which result in
  client-fuddling unexpected responses from server.

--Daily stat tracking of various interesting numbers in admin view.

--Fixed bug where the map for a shadow-table house (where the owner has died,
  but someone is still robbing it) could be deleted from the map cache out
  from underneath the robber, causing the house check-in to fail when the
  robbery ends (thanks Joshua Collins).

--Changed so that remaining backpack tools vanish when running out the door
  instead of going into the vault to prevent the convenient transfer of tools
  between two accounts (thanks Largestherb and Joshua Collins).

--Fixed a potential warning print out when server-side simulator is down.




Version 18   2013-August-27

--Fixed glitch causing visibal animal position jump-back after robber death.





Version 17   2013-August-27

--Fixed bug that was causing useLargestWindow setting to be ignored.  Now
  window size can be set by user (thanks Colorfusion).

--Fixed vision 'leak' through diagonals.

--Fixed directions that animals face when they can't see you so that they don't
  suddenly jump orientations when they come into view.

--Added a club tool (bludgeon functionality of the crowbar, without the
  door-opening capabilities, allowing it to be cheaper).  Removed
  mostly-useless voltage detector to make room for it.

--Changed so that all still-living animals jump back to their starting
  positions, if possible, post-robbery.





Version 16   Live Server Fixes

--Changed so that every house earns something in each pay interval (a minimum
  fraction of the maximum possible pay).

--Quadrupled all tool prices.

--Changed tool and tile prices according to a new four-tiered pricing model
  with a fixed build-cost/bypass-cost ratio for everything (pricing theory).

--Changed bypass-cost theory for mobile bottlenecks (pit bulls).  Direct
  bypass (gun) now costs 1x, and disabling (meat) costs 1/8x.





Version 16   2013-August-21

--Added support for web proxies (thanks Florian Yusuf Ali).

--Fixed visibility computation mismatch across platforms (caused by floating
  point round-off inconsistencies between platforms) by switching to an integer
  visibility computation.  This was causing server-side simulation of robberies
  to fail in rare cases (thanks Raymond Koo).

--Blocked quitting from game when quitting would kill player (during robbery
  and self-test).

--Animals now only follow or flee you if they can see you.

--Metal walls no longer conduct electricity.

--Removed wired wooden walls.

--Powered doors and trapdoors no longer pass power to neighboring objects.

--Added version of inicator lights that don't pass power.

--Game now runs in windowed mode by default, picking the largest window that
  fits comfortably on the user's screen.




Version 15   Live Server Fixes

--Fixed a potential deadlock involving house map cache flushing.

--Fixed unavoidable deadlock in endRobHouse by restarting transaction (thanks
  Colorfusion).

--Server now emails admin a report about each fatal error that occurs.

--Salary now based on a percentage of house value, but caps out at a fixed
  amount for houses with value greater than 10,000.

--Brand new houses are kept off the robbable list for 5 minutes from the time
  they are created by the server.  This reduces the prevalance of throw-away
  houses and also thwarts two-account collaboration where one account quickly
  dumps starting money to the other.

--Fixed so that a house containing paintings will never show an empty vault
  (though this shouldn't be possible anyway, assuming that people don't mod
  clients to allow buying paintings when their house is not being edited).

--Added function for getting email addresses of recent players in admin view.




Version 15   2013-July-23

--Fixed recording and playback of Alt-tab behavior in recordedGames.

--Changed noise generator (for house tile visual effect) to use a static seed
  (ensures pixel-consistent appearance across multiple plays).

--Fixed way of bypassing login block (pause and unpause) when version update
  needed (thanks Alex Diamond).

--Fixed bug in dogs stepping next to dead dogs that are next to other dead dogs
  (thanks Ludicrosity).

--Added a visual status display to make Ctrl-click eyedropper functionality
  more apparent.




Version 14   Live Server Fixes

--Fixed simulation mismatch (resulting in 'House checkin failed' after robbery)
  caused by salary paid during robbery, which flipped the vault state from
  empty to not empty before the end of the robbery.





Version 14   2013-July-12

--Animals now avoid stepping next to other dead animals, unless the animal is
  player-seeking and the player is standing there.  This makes it harder to use
  the dead body of one dog as a safe spot from which to club other dogs.

--Fixed bug where placing a vault or family member on top of an object
  (removing that object) was not adjusting the current cost-of-changes display
  (thanks Paciferal).




Version 13   Live Server Fixes

--Changed cost of steel walls to 30, wired wood walls to 15, and torch to 300.

--Added a retry-transaction work-around for a server database deadlock in
  endEditHouse.




Version 13   2013-July-9

--Fixed a crash that occurred when the user mistakenly launched the v12 game
  application from the v11 folder (thanks Paciferal).

--Added empty vault sprite, and changed so that reaching an empty vault does
  not end the robbery (if owner has not edited house since last robbery).  This
  eliminates grinding that was possible through damage that was saved by
  reaching a vault repeatedly in a broken house.

--Added toggle for safe movement mode (ENTER to confirm each move) for tense
  moments (thanks TheMost).





Version 12   Live Server Fixes

--Added missing column to shadow table where dead owners' houses are held to
  prevent unexpected responses from server (thanks Gardner Marshall).

--Fixed a potential deadlock on duplicate newHouse calls when a user's house
  does not yet exist.

--Changed so that vault stops earning money after it is reached by robbers
  twice (until the next owner repair).





Version 12     2013-July-4

--Animals now only start moving after the player sees them, making it
  impossible for a never-visible animal to move around behind the walls and
  trigger things mysteriously (the animal now has to be seen at least once,
  perhaps through a window, before it can start doing this).





Version 11   Live Server Fixes

--A robber's backpack contents are now discarded upon leaving the target house
  or reaching the vault.  Backpack contents are only added to the vault when a
  robber dies in the house.  Experimenting with this as a solution to the
  multi-life tool dumping loophole.

--Wife retains her half of the money (and accumulates her own salary) even
  after a robbery that reaches the vault.  Previously, after a vault robbery,
  half of the money she held would be put in the vault.  This changes prevents
  someone from whittling away at house's money by reaching the vault over and
  over without finding the wife.

--No longer reports salary earnings to you that have already been stolen.






Version 11   2013-July-2

--Fixed bug in family death detection being delayed by a step, which resulted
  in several unexpected behaviors (thanks Ukuko).

--Each security tape now has a length stat (thanks Bey Bey).





Version 10  Live Server Fixes

--Fixed bug where family positions in server-side-simulation house map did not
  match actual family positions in the case of robber suicide, causing house
  check-in after suicide (if family moved at all) to fail.





Version 10   2013-June-27

--Fixed so that you can't bypass the 'Download Latest Version' message by
  logging in again (thanks Colorfusion).

--Fixed to hide map encryption key from console printout.  Made key less
  guessable buy incorporating recent mouse movement data.

--Fixed to hide Tapes button after tools transfered between vault and backpack,
  so that transfers are not lost unexpectedly by jumping to view tapes (thanks
  Matrix).

--Fixed Tapes tool tip to explain that you leave house to view tapes
  (thanks Ukuko).

--Sleeping dogs (drugged) can no longer be killed with crowbars or woken with
  water or bricks.  This increases the tactical challenge of
  killing a dog with a crowbar (because crowbar plus drugged meat is no longer
  equivalent to a gun on a lone pit bull), balancing against the crowbar's
  lower price.  Drugged meat now turns pit bulls into indestructable land
  mines.

--Tool use no longer causes mobile objects to take a step.  This increases the
  tactical effect of animal positioning (because you can no longer use a tool
  on a wall to tune how far away an animal is from you---thanks Zed).  This
  also makes pit bulls behind doors harder to deal with (opening a door with a
  crowbar no longer brings the pit bull immediately into range for a second
  crowbar).

--Client no longer crashes when it receives a corrupted house map (instead, it
  shows a house filled with exterior walls).

--Escaped family members now return to house after robber suicide instead of
  leaving for good (thanks Largestherb).

--Fixed so that encryption key used for robbery house maps does not break when
  playing back recordedGame files (thanks Christian Stritzelberger).

--Added a Move Half button to the backpack screen that parallels the behavior
  of the Sell Half button (thanks Matrix).

--Unwatched security tapes are now highlighted in green.

--Removed SDL_LockAudio call before SDL_CloseAudio, fixing an occasional
  hang-at-exit on certain platforms.

--Dying in a house now taints the house with a chill for you that keeps you out
  of that house for one hour (thanks Zed).  Chilling houses are marked with a
  different color in the house list.




Version 9  Live Server Fixes

--Houses still earn salary if wife living, some money left in house, or one of
  last two consecutive robberies was not successful.

--In admin mode, tape name search now matches against both robber and victim.

--Houses that have reached 0 in value are now removed from the house list until
  they either earn money or are edited by their owners.  This prevents dumping
  tools in a wrecked house repeatedly across lives and also mitigates senseless
  vandalism.  Also fixed a bug where a not-robbable house could be robbed on
  the server through a hacked client, even when it was not being shown on the
  house list.

--Experimenting with paying viable houses salary every 10 minutes instead of
  every hour (to make game more lively and quicker).

--Added indexes to all columns used in WHERE and ORDER BY columns, preventing
  queries from needing to unnecessarily examine every row in a table.

--Added a hash-based map cach so that house maps aren't duplicated throughout
  various database tables (for example, a series of robbery tapes that all have
  the same starting map state) to dramatically reduce the amount of database
  storage space used by maps and robbery tapes.  Total space used dropped from
  86 KiB per user down to 20 KiB per user

--Cut 10-minute salaries in half to slow things down (you and your spouse earn
  $70 and $140 every 10 minutes).

--Backpacks are now force-returned to vaults upon viewing a tape or after 5
  minutes of no owner game activity.  Thus, backpacks can only be used for
  active robbery work and not as an infinite space to keep tools safe from
  other robbers.

--Backpacks only added to a houses vault on death or vault reach.  They are
  dumped in the street (totally lost) if the robber leaves the house.





Version 9   2013-June-14

--Removed wayward Un-Ignore All button from security tape list (thanks Dan
  Alleck).

--Fixed so that backpack purchase/sale cannot be lost by jumping to security
  tapes (Tapes button hidden after purchase/sale made) (thanks Dan Alleck).

--Wire cutters can now disable an electric floor that is off.

--Made backpack quantities unlimited (instead of one item per slot).

--Improved behavior of undo button for tool sales (undone sales are put back
  where they were sold from, vault or backpack, when possible instead of always
  being put back in the vault).

--Added server-side check to enforce maximum number of backpack slots.

--Remaining backpack contents ditched and added to victim house's vault at end
  of robbery, no matter how robbery ends (success, death, or leaving).

--House map on robbery is now encrypted by server using a changing key provided
  by the client, to weakly hide raw house map from protocol stream.  House map
  of robbery targets no longer printed to stdout.

--Disabled all blueprint functionality.

--Now saving security tapes for scouting trips where anything non-trivial
  happens (where robber at least steps beyond mat or is at least carrying
  tools that will be dropped in vault).

--Increased prices of cut-through and bypass tools (but tools that can analyze
  and meddle are still cheap).




Version 8   2013-June-3

--Added button for clearing a user's list of ignored houses (in case user
  ignores one by mistake).

--Added pencil-scratch marking on blueprints for tiles that have been damaged.

--Added server option for running in perma-permadeath mode (hard limit on
  number of lives per player).




Version 7 Live Server Fixes

--Added extra column in admin view showing edit count for a house (to monitor
  how many top houses have not been edited again since being robbed).

--Increased salary for un-broken houses by a factor of 10.




Version 7    2013-May-29

--Fixed crash in edit-screen suicide when family members have no paths to exit
  (thanks Seth Archambault).

--Fixed visual glitch in blueprints (some pixels in bottom row not being
  shadowed properly).

--Fixed bug in movement acceleration, which is meant only for panning
  (in blueprints and when paused during playback), affecting robber movement.

--Improved legibility of blueprints by adding inner shading to walls, pits,
  and trapdoors.

--Improved legibility of doors on blueprints by adding knobs.

--Panning around a blueprint during robbery now counts as activity, preventing
  the robbery checkout from becoming stale (thanks Seth Archambault).

--Fixed so that wife runs to a killed child even if she hasn't see the robber
  yet.

--Mouse-over in blueprints now shows tool tips for damaged objects 
  (thanks Zed).

--Uninteresting houses in the list can now be ignored (Ignore House button) until they change (thanks Zed).




Version 6   2013-May-24

--Fixed so that tools with reach cannot be used through unbroken windows
  (thanks Buddy Gorven).

--Changed house menus to remember page position and search string (so you
  don't have to scroll through the high-value houses over and over to get to
  your houses of interest).  Less clicking, less server load (thanks Michael 
  Weber).

--Fixed so that suicide on doorstep (first move) shows up on tape.

--After login fails, client now re-asks reflector for server URL, in case user
  types different email second time that should bounce them to a different
  server (thanks Martijn van der Ven).

--Fixed bug that caused %s to replace family names after death (thanks Stan
  Volchenok).

--Fixed memory leak in robbery checkout.

--Fixed wife path return behavior after child death (she used to return to the
  point from which she started searching for her dead child, and now she
  returns to her original location).

--Fixed bug where family blocked in by other dead family members do not die
  permanently.

--Fixed serial number ordering during request retry when other, later requests
  are waiting in the request queue.

--Fixed bug in left-right power propagation triggering voltage-triggered
  switches immediately to the south.

--Added new objects for horizontal-only and vertical-only wiring (thanks Gavin
  Delphia).

--[Live server fix, May 8, 2013]  Experimenting with salaries on server only
  being paid for houses that haven't been robbed since the last edit.

--Crowbar now can open a wooden door without stepping through it.

--Fixed encoding of emails to support (vaild) emails that contain '+'.

--Fixed so that tools can't be used after death.

--Fixed so that animals can never step onto the welcome mat spot.

--[Live server fix, May 9, 2013]  Now saves separate, pristine copy of house
  maps to go along with self-test move list, even after main house map has been
  changed by robbery.

--Fixed bug in suicide tool tip lingering on Accept button after robber dies.

--Added confirmation box for suicide button.

--Changed family behavior to only head toward exit when they see the robber,
  making it possible to build structures that actually protect them (since
  robber can no longer just wait at the exit until the family comes out).

--Added indicator light house object.

--Name search filter now permits multiple words.

--Improved view panning so that player is never closer than three grid squares
  from the edge of the screen, while also making the view movement less jumpy
  and more consistent.

--You can now watch security tapes before re-editing and testing your house
  after your house has been robbed.

--Added tool tip explaining keyboard shortcut for Undo (Ctrl-Z).

--Control-click acts as "eyedropper" to select tile under mouse for placement.

--Further improved wording on house self-test screen.

--Mode for selling multiple items (half of items in slot with one click).

--Fixed linking to wiki and forums and news from download pages.

--Improved appearance of wired wooden walls (no internal, dead-end plugs).

--Fixed visual glitches in pits when they cross northern view edge.

--Fixed tool tip for mobile over empty floor (no longer describes floor).

--Made all cross-wiring less visually noisy (all wiring fat, no skinny wire
  leads).

--Free blueprints for all houses are now available.

--Enabled panning with arrow keys (like blueprint panning) during tape replay
  when visibility shroud is toggled off (only works when replay paused).

--Fixed bug when tool used on animal that is standing on another targetable
  tile (like a crowbar againsta a pit bull standing on a voltage-triggered
  switch).  Now mobile is affected before underlying tile (thanks Jeremy
  Oertel).

--Tool tips for house tiles now display properly during tape replay if shroud
  toggled off.

--Fixed so that family standing on welcome mat can't be targeted (than Jeremy
  Oertel).

--Added database column tracking time of last owner visit to each house.

--Fixed server database size calculation to exclude tables in backup databases.






Version 5_serverFixes   2013-May-1

--Added extra logging to server to track down name collision and house deletion
  issues.

--Extra server logging for all denied transactions.

--Fixed main server install to properly use InnoDB table engine to fix 
  concurrency issues (my web server had InnoDB disabled before).

--Fixed order of row locks in server to avoid deadlock when two players are
  robbing each other.

--Improved speed of InnoDB table access by using indexed columns in WHERE
  clauses for high-volume queries (this also prevents entire table from being
  locked).

--Web admin view support for search on player name history.

--Paging display for log entries, and stack traces in log for fatal errors.

--Fixed MiB and GiB formatting in database size report.

--Fixed server bug that caused start of self-test to fail after house checkin
  failed once for whatever reason (thanks Tom Loughlin).

--Made start/end_self_test more lenient on server (not sending FAILED in cases
  that are likely caused by timeouts and client retries).

--Made other calls on server more tolerant of client retries.

--Fixed server so that money gained from selling tools can be used to buy
  paintings without checking in the house first (thanks Samuel Walz).

--Improved server flush routine to release locks throughout (so that other
  client requests are not blocked as much during a flush).

--Added support for calling server flush from a cron job instead of
  front-loading it onto client requests.

--Fixed bug in wife money tracking after security tape restart.

--Fixed server-side blocking of tool use in self-test move list.

--Fixed bug in tool targets lingering in next robbery if tool use canceled by 
  walking out the door or current robbery.

--Fixed bug in replay with visibility shroud off that showed extra tool 
  targets.

(Changes up to here comprised headless client for v5, installed server-side 
 for robbery verificationon April 26, 2013.)

--Fixed another inconsistency in behavior of the server during robbery-end if
  client is retrying the request (thanks Jeremy Oertel).

--Fixed crashes in headless client when move list contains invalid values.

--Blocked salary accumulation in houses that have never been edited (if player
  quits after dying but before editing house).




Version 5   2013-March-11

--Ridiculous.  Forgot to update client version number from 3 to 4 in last
  release, so the v4 server rejects it.  To avoid confusion for people who
  downloaded the bad v4 client, the new client is v5 (with no other changes).




Version 4   2013-March-11

--Added an on-screen button for typing '@' symbol on non-US keyboards.

--House proving screen now explains that you can't use tools.

--Changed living family members to jump back to original positions post-robbery
  (thanks Thibaut Girka).

--Added tool and object occurrence reports to admin view.




Version 3   2013-March-8

--Fixed bug in game playback that could not handle extra recording argument 
  (change highlights on/off flag).

--Fixed a server-side bug that was causing house pings to fail when a user was
  editing their house after robbing a house, and the robbed house was
  simultaneously being edited by that house's owner (thanks Jeremiah Reid, who 
  was spuriously timed out of his house 20 times). 

--Fixed SQL query bug when searching house tables in web admin UI.

--Dealt with houses-to-rob scarcity issue by keeping houses robbable after they
  are successfully robbed the first time, as their money dwindles.  Before, a
  house could only be robbed once before going back on the must-edit-again
  queue. 

--Fixed server bug that caused paintings to disappear from circulation when 
  family members killed but vault not reached.

--Server prevents a dual-client setup from keeping robber's own house checked 
  out for edit during robbery and other non-edit actions.

--Fixed bug that allowed walking over electrified floors post-robbery.

--Fixed suicide button misbehavior when self-test forced post-robbery.

--'Leave <-' message now pops in instantly if gallery is empty.

--Backpack now resets properly when Restart button hit in robbery replay.

--Added Faster button for robbery replays.

--Server now saves your changed gallery ordering even if you haven't modified
  your house otherwise (thanks Jeremiah Reid).

--Ending a security tape now takes you back to security tape menu instead of 
  main menu (thanks Jeremiah Reid).

--Changed wording to 'View YOUR security tapes' to avoid confusion (some people
  pick a house from the to-rob list and try to click that tape button).

--Better wording of family exit warning (Family needs empty path to exit).

--Better wording on house self-test page (reach your own vault).

--Fixed long painting buy button tool tips that hung off edge of screen.

--Fixed door/window orientation bug in north/south hallways.

--Tool tip to explain the gravity of suicide.

--Clicking object picker now brings up grid picker, in addition to clicking
  grid button (thanks David Pittman).

--Moving around no longer bumps object picker to top of stack (thanks Malcom 
  McCrimmon).

--Server now only archives robbery logs for dead owners 1 day, and living
  owners 5 days.

--Player earns $14 and wife earns $28 for each hour that player spends away 
  from house.

--Server now has a shutdown mode to block player requests during maintenance.

--Fixed so that remapping WASD keys doesn't interfer with typing for searches.

--Game client times out requests to server after 16 seconds and retries them
  instead of giving up.

--Fixed house pick lists so that tool tips don't linger when mouse leaves.

--Removed down arrow when house pick list has a full page of results but no
  additional pages (thanks Jeremiah Reid).

--Water wakes sleeping animals.  Sleeping animals can be killed.  Bricks wake
  sleeping pit bulls.  Bricks kill chihuahuas and cats.

--Ladder tool to cross trapdoors and pits.

--Fixed stickiness of voltage detectors applied to wires and fixed a stickiness
  bug with pit bulls fallen inside a closed trapdoor.





Version 2    2013-February-27    (private pre-alpha)

--Added recording and playback of time() values in game recording system.  This
  fixes playback timing bugs when the playback machine runs the game slower
  or faster than the original recording machine (or when playback is manually
  slowed or sped up).

--Removed an error-prone initial mouse-warp-to-center call that was potentially
  causing future mouse motion events to be ignored.
  
--Fixed server typo that resulted in stolen paintings not being added to the
  robber's house (thanks Allen Trivette).

--Fixed TextField glitchy behavior when user types forbidden characters.

--Fixed major bug in path finding for family-blocked-in detection 
  (thanks Eric McQuiggan). 

--Fixed tool tip bug that triggered music toggle button tip spuriously 
  (thanks Garrett).

--Fixed so that empty self-test recordings (when user edits backpack but 
  not house map) do not replace last valid self-test recording in database.

--Fixed 'Family blocked in' message overlaying Done button on house load.

--Fixed dead wife sprites overhanging walls (and also moved all dead objects 
  under wall shadows, which looks much better).

--Added better logging of flush operations on server.

--Fixed lingering pitbull attack stance post-robbery.

--Fixed so that erase highlights (darkening) in editor match state of object 
  being erased.

--Changed so that picking up a family member who is standing with a mobile does
  not erase that mobile.

--Fixed so that dead wife not shown carrying money during self tests.

--Security tapes are now saved whenever a robber dies (so owners can see their 
  traps working).

--Added push-doors (thanks Nicholas Rodine).

--Tweaked window position to line up with push-doors.

--Fixed typing @ on Spanish keyboards (thanks Manuel Magalhaes).

--Fixed window title.

--Greatly improved seek/avoid mobile behavior so that they don't get stuck on 
  corners (thanks Nicholas Rodine).

--Added key repeat after holding movement key for 0.5+ seconds (to move across 
  house with less tedium than pressing [->] 32 times).

--Added 'Pick one:' to picker grids to make them less confusing (thanks 
  Madeleine Burleson).

--Leaving house edit due to inactivity now returns you to the menu instead of 
  right back to checking out your own house (less confusing if your house is 
  being robbed in the meantime).

--Changed so that house never times out during first edit (when house isn't 
  vulnerable to being robbed anyway, because you must edit it first) (thanks 
  Madeleine Burleson).

--Added suicide button to edit page when balance is 0.

--Revamped house edit billing to only charge for differences from old map,
  allowing you to place, erase, and replace walls many times during the same
  editing session without incuring cost of each replacement.  Makes editing
  much more fluid and less Undo-button dependent.  Also allows mobiles
  to be moved around without cost (because you are only charged for those 
  placed in excess of the ones already in your house).

--Added (optional) highlight features that shows the changes made to the
