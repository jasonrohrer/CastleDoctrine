Version 6

--Added extra logging to server to track down name collision and house deletion
  issues.

--Extra server logging for all denied transactions.

--Fixed main server install to properly use InnoDB table engine to fix 
  concurrency issues (my web server had InnoDB disabled before).

--Fixed order of row locks in server to avoid deadlock when two players are
  robbing each other.

--Improved speed of InnoDB table access by using indexed columns in WHERE
  clauses for high-volume queries (this also prevents entire table from being
  locked).

--Web admin view support for search on player name history.

--Paging display for log entries, and stack traces in log for fatal errors.

--Fixed MiB and GiB formatting in database size report.

--Fixed server bug that caused start of self-test to fail after house checkin
  failed once for whatever reason (thanks Tom Loughlin).

--Made start/end_self_test more lenient on server (not sending FAILED in cases
  that are likely caused by timeouts and client retries).

--Made other calls on server more tolerant of client retries.

--Fixed server so that money gained from selling tools can be used to buy
  paintings without checking in the house first (thanks Samuel Walz).



Version 5   2013-March-11

--Ridiculous.  Forgot to update client version number from 3 to 4 in last
  release, so the v4 server rejects it.  To avoid confusion for people who
  downloaded the bad v4 client, the new client is v5 (with no other changes).




Version 4   2013-March-11

--Added an on-screen button for typing '@' symbol on non-US keyboards.

--House proving screen now explains that you can't use tools.

--Changed living family members to jump back to original positions post-robbery
  (thanks Thibaut Girka).

--Added tool and object occurrence reports to admin view.




Version 3   2013-March-8

--Fixed bug in game playback that could not handle extra recording argument 
  (change highlights on/off flag).

--Fixed a server-side bug that was causing house pings to fail when a user was
  editing their house after robbing a house, and the robbed house was
  simultaneously being edited by that house's owner (thanks Jeremiah Reid, who 
  was spuriously timed out of his house 20 times). 

--Fixed SQL query bug when searching house tables in web admin UI.

--Dealt with houses-to-rob scarcity issue by keeping houses robbable after they
  are successfully robbed the first time, as their money dwindles.  Before, a
  house could only be robbed once before going back on the must-edit-again
  queue. 

--Fixed server bug that caused paintings to disappear from circulation when 
  family members killed but vault not reached.

--Server prevents a dual-client setup from keeping robber's own house checked 
  out for edit during robbery and other non-edit actions.

--Fixed bug that allowed walking over electrified floors post-robbery.

--Fixed suicide button misbehavior when self-test forced post-robbery.

--'Leave <-' message now pops in instantly if gallery is empty.

--Backpack now resets properly when Restart button hit in robbery replay.

--Added Faster button for robbery replays.

--Server now saves your changed gallery ordering even if you haven't modified
  your house otherwise (thanks Jeremiah Reid).

--Ending a security tape now takes you back to security tape menu instead of 
  main menu (thanks Jeremiah Reid).

--Changed wording to 'View YOUR security tapes' to avoid confusion (some people
  pick a house from the to-rob list and try to click that tape button).

--Better wording of family exit warning (Family needs empty path to exit).

--Better wording on house self-test page (reach your own vault).

--Fixed long painting buy button tool tips that hung off edge of screen.

--Fixed door/window orientation bug in north/south hallways.

--Tool tip to explain the gravity of suicide.

--Clicking object picker now brings up grid picker, in addition to clicking
  grid button (thanks David Pittman).

--Moving around no longer bumps object picker to top of stack (thanks Malcom 
  McCrimmon).

--Server now only archives robbery logs for dead owners 1 day, and living
  owners 5 days.

--Player earns $14 and wife earns $28 for each hour that player spends away 
  from house.

--Server now has a shutdown mode to block player requests during maintenance.

--Fixed so that remapping WASD keys doesn't interfer with typing for searches.

--Game client times out requests to server after 16 seconds and retries them
  instead of giving up.

--Fixed house pick lists so that tool tips don't linger when mouse leaves.

--Removed down arrow when house pick list has a full page of results but no
  additional pages ((thanks Jeremiah Reid).

--Water wakes sleeping animals.  Sleeping animals can be killed.  Bricks wake
  sleeping pit bulls.  Bricks kill chihuahuas and cats.

--Ladder tool to cross trapdoors and pits.

--Fixed stickiness of voltage detectors applied to wires and fixed a stickiness
  bug with pit bulls fallen inside a closed trapdoor.





Version 2    2013-February-27    (private pre-alpha)

--Added recording and playback of time() values in game recording system.  This
  fixes playback timing bugs when the playback machine runs the game slower
  or faster than the original recording machine (or when playback is manually
  slowed or sped up).

--Removed an error-prone initial mouse-warp-to-center call that was potentially
  causing future mouse motion events to be ignored.
  
--Fixed server typo that resulted in stolen paintings not being added to the
  robber's house (thanks Allen Trivette).

--Fixed TextField glitchy behavior when user types forbidden characters.

--Fixed major bug in path finding for family-blocked-in detection 
  (thanks Eric McQuiggan). 

--Fixed tool tip bug that triggered music toggle button tip spuriously 
  (thanks Garrett).

--Fixed so that empty self-test recordings (when user edits backpack but 
  not house map) do not replace last valid self-test recording in database.

--Fixed 'Family blocked in' message overlaying Done button on house load.

--Fixed dead wife sprites overhanging walls (and also moved all dead objects 
  under wall shadows, which looks much better).

--Added better logging of flush operations on server.

--Fixed lingering pitbull attack stance post-robbery.

--Fixed so that erase highlights (darkening) in editor match state of object 
  being erased.

--Changed so that picking up a family member who is standing with a mobile does
  not erase that mobile.

--Fixed so that dead wife not shown carrying money during self tests.

--Security tapes are now saved whenever a robber dies (so owners can see their 
  traps working).

--Added push-doors (thanks Nicholas Rodine).

--Tweaked window position to line up with push-doors.

--Fixed typing @ on Spanish keyboards (thanks Manuel Magalhaes).

--Fixed window title.

--Greatly improved seek/avoid mobile behavior so that they don't get stuck on 
  corners (thanks Nicholas Rodine).

--Added key repeat after holding movement key for 0.5+ seconds (to move across 
  house with less tedium than pressing [->] 32 times).

--Added 'Pick one:' to picker grids to make them less confusing (thanks 
  Madeleine Burleson).

--Leaving house edit due to inactivity now returns you to the menu instead of 
  right back to checking out your own house (less confusing if your house is 
  being robbed in the meantime).

--Changed so that house never times out during first edit (when house isn't 
  vulnerable to being robbed anyway, because you must edit it first) (thanks 
  Madeleine Burleson).

--Added suicide button to edit page when balance is 0.

--Revamped house edit billing to only charge for differences from old map,
  allowing you to place, erase, and replace walls many times during the same
  editing session without incuring cost of each replacement.  Makes editing
  much more fluid and less Undo-button dependent.  Also allows mobiles
  to be moved around without cost (because you are only charged for those 
  placed in excess of the ones already in your house).

--Added (optional) highlight features that shows the changes made to the
  current house map as you edit it.
