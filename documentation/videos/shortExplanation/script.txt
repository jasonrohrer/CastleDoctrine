Suppose you're this guy.

Maybe you're DAVID RUSSEL WALKER.

And this is your family.

And you got this house.  It doesn't look like much right now, but here's your vault.  You got 2000 dollars free and clear to build whatever you want.

But we're not talkin' couch covers and lampshades.

'Cause this is your neighborhood.

Dozens of people just like you, and they all need more money just like you, and that 2000 bucks you've got is lookin' mighty nice to them, and sooner or later, they'll be comin' for it.

Whoops.  Guess it was sooner.

While you were out checkin' out your neighborhood, your wife was killed, and her money was taken, and your vault was hit too, and you got nothing left, so you end it.

Now you're starting from scratch, and maybe now you're BRADFORD J. FOREMAN, with a new family.
