Suppose you're this guy.

Maybe you're DAVID RUSSEL WALKER.

And this is your family.

And you got this house.  It doesn't look like much right now, but here's your vault, where you got two thousand free and clear to build whatever you want.

But we're not talkin' couch covers and lampshades.

'Cause this is your neighborhood.

Dozens of people just like you, and they all need more money just like you, and that two thousand you got is lookin' good to them, and sooner or later, they're gonna be comin' for it.

Whoops.  Guess it was sooner.

While you were checkin' out the neighborhood, your wife was killed, her money was taken, and your vault was hit too.  You watch the security tape to see the bastard who did it.


and you got nothing left, so you end it.

Now you're startin' from scratch, and maybe now you're BRADFORD J. FOREMAN, with a new family.
