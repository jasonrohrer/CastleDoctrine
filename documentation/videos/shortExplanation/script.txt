Suppose you're DAVID RUSSEL WALKER.

This is your family.

This is your house.  It doesn't look like much right now, but here's your vault, inside you have two thousand dollars to build whatever you want.

This is your neighbourhood.

There are dozens of people just like you. Sooner or later, they’re going to try to get your money.

Looks like it already happened.

While you were out looking around your neighborhood, your wife was killed, her money was taken, and your vault was compromised too. You watch the security tape to see who did it. DANIEL HERBERT GETZ. You'll remember that name.

Now you’ve got nothing left, so you end it. You start from scratch. Now you're BRADFORD J. FOREMAN, with a new family and a fresh 2000.

This time, you build something for Mr. Getz in case he returns.

But you need to be careful. You can't completely block your family in; they need an obstacle-free path to the exit.

Also, your security can't be so good that it keeps you out. You’ve got to be able to reach your own vault without dying.

This is dangerous stuff you're building. You're hoping it will kill Mr. Getz, but it can kill you too. When you die in this game, you lose everything and start over.

You learn this the hard way, at the jaws of your own pit bull.

Now you’re ERIC JOHN GUFFEY. You build a better house this time. You test your traps carefully with indicator lights and chihuahuas in place of trapdoors and pitbulls.

Finally you get it all working without killing yourself.  You spend some of the left-over money on robbery tools, then you head out into the night to risk your own life breaking into other people's houses, hoping to build up your funds.

I'm Jason, and this is my massively multiplayer game The Castle Doctrine. Over the past two years I’ve hand-crafted every single pixel, line of code and musical note.

It's brutal, sad, hilarious, and tense.  One moment you’ll be filled with the thrill of triumph, and the next, despair.  Nothing is random, every outcome in this world is the result of choices made by its players.

This game gives you an enormous amount of freedom and power.  What you do with it is up to you. I'll be keeping a close eye on my own security tapes. Maybe I'll catch you there one of these days.
