Suppose you're this guy.

Maybe you're DAVID RUSSEL WALKER.

And this is your family.

And you got this house.  It doesn't look like much right now, but here's your vault, where you got two thousand free and clear to build whatever you want.

But we're not talkin' couch covers and lampshades.

'Cause this is your neighborhood.

Dozens of people just like you, and they all need more money just like you, and that two thousand you got is lookin' good to them, and sooner or later, they're gonna be comin' for it.

Whoops.  Guess it was sooner.

While you were checkin' out the neighborhood, your wife was killed, her money was taken, and your vault was hit too.  You watch the security tape to see who did it.  DANIEL HERBERT GETZ.  You'll remember that name.


And now you got nothin left, so you end it, and start from scratch, and maybe now you're BRADFORD J. FOREMAN, with a new family and a fresh 2000.

This time you build something for Mr. Getz in case he visits.
