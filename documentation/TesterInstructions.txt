== Getting the Game ==

Download instructions should be arriving to each of you shortly in a private email.

Your Download Code will be displayed on your download page.  Make sure to COPY it to the clipboard so that you can PASTE it into the game upon first launch.



== Recorded Games ==

Every time you play the game, your whole experience is saved in the "recordedGames" folder as a compact text file.  This is extremely useful for testing and debugging:

1) PLEASE take the time to send me the recording of your first few games (the first few times you log in and poke around the game).  By watching your games, I can hopefully pinpoint stuff that was confusing.  Kinda like me watching quietly over your shoulder, but remotely and asynchronously.

2) If you encounter what seems like a bug or a glitch, quit the game (ESC) and send me the last recorded game file.  I can watch your game on my end, which will replay the bad behavior for me and help me fix the problem.

3) If the game crashes, send me the last recorded game file along with a description of what happened right before the crash.  I can hopefully reproduce the crash on my end.

4) If there's some other issue that you have with the game---balancing or difficulty or general confusion---you can potentially send a recorded game that illustrates the problem along with your report.

5) If you type messages on the PAUSE screen, I'll see those in your recorded game too.  You can use this feature to document your thoughts as you play.
