This document explains how to connect custom source builds to the main server.

Connecting to a server requires that you equip your client with the same
shared secret that the server is using.  The client source code ships with a
default secret that matches the secret present in the server source files.
Thus, you can connect to your own unmodified server without changing anything.


If you want to connect your custom-compiled client to the main server, however,
you will need to change the client's secret before building.


The secret can be changed by editing the following file:

CastleDoctrine/gameSource/sharedServerSecret.cpp


Okay, easy enough, but what shared secret is the main server expecting?


First, please be aware of what you are about to do:  connect a client that you
have compiled yourself to the live server where the vast majority of players
are playing with unmodified binaries that were supplied directly by me.
Reflect for a moment about all the sweat and tears that each of those players
have poured into their houses.  While it would be a major accomplishment to
rob those houses through your legitimate skills in the game, it would be
no accomplishment at all to rob those houses through your skills as a hacker.
After all, I'm handing you the source code.

Yes, while most security and cheating issues have been addressed, the server 
still trusts the client with the full map during every robbery.  Most of that
map is meant to be hidden from the player.  Your custom-compiled client should 
keep it that way.

This is a game made entirely, from scratch, by one person over two years.  I'm
running this beast on a shoestring budget server.  The game protocol is
asynchronous:  you check a house out from the server, play in that house
(either editing it if it's yours, or robbing it if not), and then check the
house back in to the server.  The server then verifies that everything you
claim to have done is legitimate.  But what you actually did can be quite
different from what you claim to have done.  In an asynchronous model, which
has enormous advantages in every other way, there's simply no way around this.

Peeking at the map or giving yourself an "undo" button during robbery is
totally possible.  But please don't connect to the main server with a client
that does this.

Okay... so you read all that, right?  Here's the secret that the main server
is expecting:


"Please do not use this secret string to connect unfairly modded clients to the main server.  Keep in mind that this is an indie, open-source game made entirely by one person.  I am trusting you to do the right thing.  --Jason"


That's all one long line, with one space after each word and two spaces after
each period.

And why such a weird secret string?  Well, it shows up in the binary itself, so
anyone hacking with a hex editor will encounter it and read it.

This is not "security by obscurity" but rather "security by awareness."  No
one can hack the game by accident without realizing what they are doing
and what my wishes are.
