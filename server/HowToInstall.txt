This a quick guide to help you set up and run your own server for 
The Castle Doctrine.  Experience with web server administration and installing
PHP/MySQL scripts is assumed.  I don't explain how to create a MySQL database,
for example (ask your web hosting company for help if you need it).




1.  Get a ticketServer up and running.

This controls access to your server.  You give the players tickets to let
them play on your server.  No ticket, no access.

The PHP for the ticketServer is in:

minorGems/game/ticketServer/


A. Set up a MySQL database and database user, and edit settings.php to point to
   that database.

B. Edit various other settings in settings.php as you see fit.  In particular,
   be sure to replace the various "secrets" (hex strings) with your own
   unguessable values (try running md5 or sha1sums of some random typing, plus
   some randomly-chosen files).

C. After you change $passwordHashingPepper, pick an admin password and go
   here to generate a hash of it:

   http://myserver/ticketServer/passwordHashUtility.php

   Paste that generated hash into the $accessPasswords array.  You can
   specify multiple hashes there if you want multiple admin passwords.

D. You probably want to turn Yubikey support off (unless you have Yubikeys,
   which of course you should).

E. You should be ready for web-based database table setup now.  Go to:

   http://myserver/ticketServer/server.php

F. Assuming that all the tables were generated, your ticket server should
   be ready for you to login.  Go to:

   http://myserver/ticketServer/

G. Log in.  Create tickets for your users.  A user will need both their
   email address and ticket ID to log into your game server.  You probably
   DON'T want to send out the ticketServer's automated emails, because
   those are about how to download the game itself (which you're probably
   not hosting on your ticketServer).






2. Get the game server up and running.

The PHP for the game server is in (where this How To Guide is):

CastleDoctrine/server/


A. Follow exactly the same steps (A through E) that you followed for setting
   up the ticketServer (but this time, apply those steps to the game server).


F. In settings.php for the game server, make sure that $ticketServerURL
   points to where you installed your ticket server (can be on separate
   physical servers if you want).

   Also, make sure that $sharedEncryptionSecret is the SAME as the one in
   ticketServer/settings.php

   This URL and shared secret will be used to verify that ticket IDs are
   correct when players log into the game server.

G. Assuming that all is well, your game server should be ready for you to 
   login.  Go to:

   http://myserver/server/

G. Log in.  No users should have houses showing up yet, but they will soon.






3. Install the reflector (CastleDoctrine/reflector) and edit server.php
   to point to your server.




4. Tell your users to edit settings/reflectorURL.ini in their game to point
   at your reflector.  That will bounce them to your server.



5. Email ticket IDs to your users.  


6. When a player logs in for the first time, the ticketServer will be checked
   to verify their access, and then a house will be created (and show up
   in your admin view) on the game server.


7. Users that you mark as admins will get extra features enabled in their
   game (like being able to replay all robberies, and being able to watch
   other players' self-test replays).  But they WON'T be able to log into
   the web-based admin view (unless you give them a password).


8. (Optional but recommended).  Edit checkForFlush.sh to point to your server.
   Set up a cron job that calls this script on a regular interval.
   Suggested interval:  every minute.  Edit settings.php for your game server
   and set $flushDuringClientCalls to false.  This will remove the load for
   server flushes from client calls, reducing the maximum response time for
   a client.




Why is this game server split into three parts?

For scalability, the reflector can redirect different users
to different servers according to their email address.  This isn't implemented
yet, but can easily be implemented if needed (see reflector/protocol.txt).

ticketServer was code that I've already used for two other games, so I wanted
to keep that separate (and central:  even if users are playing on different
servers, they can buy the game through one central server).  It made sense
to also use it as a point of server access control (as well as serving up 
downloads of the game).
