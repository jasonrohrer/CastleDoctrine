All returns are whitespace-delimited.



Most calls can return 'DENIED' on failure

Some calls can return 'SHUTDOWN' when the server has been switched into
shutdown mode.  After this, subsequent calls to server may be unsafe in terms
of houses being lost, etc.  Client should stop immediately (and a client that
gets a SHUTDOWN response on startup should stop and tell user to try again
later).



=== Call:
server.php?action=check_user&email=[signup email address]

Returns:
minVersionNumber
userID
sequenceNumber
adminStatus
OK

Where:
minVersionNumber = minimum client version number compatible with this server
userID = unique user ID number
sequenceNumber = sequence number for hmac-sha1 secure hashing of download keys
                 to sign future transactions.  Any transactions using
                 lower sequence numbers will be denied as stale replays. 
adminStatus = 0 or 1



== General Note:
To verify the identity of the user making each transaction, a hash of
that user's original download ticket ID is included with the transaction call.
That hash is constructed in the following way:

  HMAC_SHA1( download_ticket_id, sequence_number )

Where the two inputs are the download ticket ID and the ascii, base-10 
representation of the sequence number.

Each transaction updates the sequence number associated with the user on
the server.  Each subsequent transaction must use a new sequence number to
thwart replay attacks.

Thus, the ticket ID is never sent from the client to the server, yet the
server can verify that the client making the transaction is indeed in 
possession of the ticket ID (which only one person in the world should have).




=== Call:
server.php?action=check_hmac&user_id=[id number]
                            &sequence_number=[number]
                            &ticket_hmac=[hmac-sha1, hex-encoded]
Returns:
OK





=== Call:
server.php?action=start_edit_house&user_id=[id number]
                                  &sequence_number=[number]
                                  &ticket_hmac=[hmac-sha1, hex-encoded]
Returns:
houseMap
vault_contents
backpack_contents
gallery_contents
price_list
current_balance
must_self_test
music_seed
wife_name
son_name
daughter_name
payment_count
you_paid_total
wife_paid_total
OK

Where:
houseMap = ASCII string representing the house layout, like:

object_id#object_id#object_id#object_id

OR

object_id:state#object_id:state#object_id#object_id

If ":state" not present, then default state is implied
If ":state" includes "!" at the end, that marks a stuck state.
Example:  100:2!#10:3!#5#3:0

Cells are separated by "#"

Multiple objects can be present in each cell, separated by commas, like this:

object_id:state#object_id:state,object_id:state#object_id#object_id,object_id

Note that this is used to encode the presense of mobile objects (which can
 share a cell with non-mobile, non-blocking objects)



vault_contents = ASCII string containing ID:quantity pairs, like:

101:3#3:10#5:1#102:1

(If empty, string is a single "#")


backpack_contents = ASCII string, same format as vault_contents

gallery_contents = ASCII string containing list of IDs, like:
2001#2010#2200

(If empty, string is a single "#")



price_list = ASCII string containing ID@price pairs, like:

LIST_NUMBER:1@10#2@20#5@25:SIGNATURE

Where SIGNATURE is computed as follows:

HMAC_SHA1( server_secret, LIST_NUMBER . list_body )

Where "." is concatonate, and the resulting HMAC is hex encoded.

Each LIST_NUMBER can only be used once by a given user in a house 
modification, and then it becomes stale.


And:

current_balance = player's current money balance in whole dollars.

must_self_test = 1 if player must test house before submitting it, or 
                 0 otherwise

music_seed = integer used to seed music generator for this house's song





=== Call:

Returns:
OK
or
FAILED  (in the case of a house that has gone stale)

Note:
Tells server that house owner has started a self test.
If house goes stale during self test, it is assumed that user quit
during self test and thus died (example:  quit right before unavoidable death).
Counts as a house ping.




=== Call:
server.php?action=end_self_test&user_id=[id number]
                               &sequence_number=[number]
                               &ticket_hmac=[hmac-sha1, hex-encoded]
Returns:
OK
or
FAILED  (in the case of a house that has gone stale)

Note:
Tells server that house owner has left a self test (Leave action) without dying
or completing it.  Owner has returned to editing the house.
On house test success or death, end_self_test should not be sent (instead,
house should be checked in with the result).
Counts as a house ping.







=== Call:
server.php?action=end_edit_house&user_id=[id number]
                                &sequence_number=[number]

								&self_test_move_list=[move list ASCII string]
                                &family_exit_paths=[paths ASCII string]
Returns:
OK


Where:

died is 1 if player died while testing house, 0 if test a success, or 2 
if self-test not needed (no changes since last complete edit).

vault_contents and backpack_contents take the same format as the return values
of start_edit_house.

price_list is the list returned by start_edit_house


purchase_list (and sell_list) is encoded as a series of ID:quantity pairs, 
like:

101:3#3:10#5:1#102:1

(If empty, string is a single "#")


For self_test_move_list format, see move_list in end_rob_house, except that
tool use is forbidden during self test.  
Empty move list represented by a single "#".


family_exit_paths are separated by ##, and each path is a series of map
indices separated by #, like:

515#514#513#512##483#482#481#513#512

Paths start at family member location and end at house start location.
To be valid, path must be contigous and completely unobstructed (only mobiles
and other family members can be present on path)

(If empty, string is just "##").

Returns:
OK
or
FAILED  (in the case of a house that has gone stale and can't be pinged)

Note:
Proves that house is still being actively edited or robbed, keeping the
house checked out.  Without regular pings, the house will time out
and automatically check back in.  Houses are considered stale after 5
minutes of no pings.

user_id is the owner in the case of a house being edited,
and user_id is the robber in the case of a house being robbed.
